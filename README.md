## Alternatives

Optionally is no longer maintained. Instead, you should be using a more
feature-complete alternative, like [Symfony's Console](https://github.com/symfony/Console),
which is not only stable, it's also actively maintained. I tend not to write
as much open source PHP these days, I'm not overly fond of the language itself,
but the ecosystem is vibrant, and there are fantastic alternatives out there.
It's pointless for me to put any further effort into Optionally to clean it
up and finish it.

I'm over my days of Not-Invented-Here and would rather use well-maintained
projects that do exactly what I want (plus or minus some delta) than reimplement
a feature or library and do so poorly. You should do the same, if you're using
Optionally.

## Other Thoughts

GitHub's recent and fairly blatant political shift toward "social justice" is
also disconcerting, and I'm in the process of migrating whatever repositories
I've been maintaining either to a self-hosted GitLab instance or (possibly) to
other providers.

I have little interest in supporting a company, even indirectly, if employees
of theirs consider my patronage worthless simply due to the merit of my ethnicity,
lack of melanin, or similar. The march forward of so-called "social justice" is
dangerous and, in my opinion, tainted with an inkling of totalitarian philosophy.
Individuals who do not fit well into specific categories worthy of protection
are to be snuffed out, marginalized, and forgotten. I do not support, condone,
or subscribe to this exceedingly misguided school of thought. I regret invoking
Godwin's Law, but this is the stuff of Nazism. Stop it.

This will also be your failure if you choose to continue down this path. The
market will decide.
