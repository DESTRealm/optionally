Optionally is an Optimist- (NodeJS) like API and getopt wrapper for PHP.
Although Optionally isn't a direct decendent of Optimist for reasons mostly
related to quirks in both PHP and its author, it does adhere to many of the same
principles first introduced in popular usage by Optimist for handling command
line arguments.
